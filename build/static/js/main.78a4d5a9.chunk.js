Petrols and diesels produce power by burning fuel, and this creates sooty exhaust gases. Emissions control devices such as catalysts and diesel particulate filters keep the amount of soot which reaches the atmosphere to a minimum, but there is still some which is deposited on components inside the engine and exhaust system."}),Object(s.jsx)("p",{children:"Vintage cars built before modern oils and fuel technology came about would need a \u2018decoke\u2019 every few thousand miles, which involved opening up the engine and physically scraping off the carbon deposits.

However, many modern engines use Gasoline Direct Injection to improve efficiency where petrol is squirted directly into the combustion chamber and doesn\u2019t get passed over as many parts. This means some GDI engines have a reputation for becoming clogged."}),Object(s.jsx)("p",{children:"Diesels are even more affected, as the fuel itself doesn\u2019t burn as cleanly. The exhaust gases are often fed back into the combustion chamber to be burned again and this movement of sooty fumes is bound to result in a build-up of deposits over time. Once the fumes are finally expelled from the engine they still have to pass through a particulate filter and a catalyst. These too can become clogged with carbon deposits."}),Object(s.jsx)("h4",{children:"How to avoid the need for carbon cleaning"}),Object(s.jsx)("p",{children:"The best way to stop carbon deposits from becoming an issue is to keep the car maintained well. Regular servicing using good quality oil and filters is essential. It\u2019s also important to give your car a good run occasionally.
