Clean service is suitable for any petrol, diesel or LPG engine, mobile and static, and is used to help remove carbon build-up on an extensive range of engines from 1 to 100 litres.</h3>\n\n            <h4>How it Works</h4> \n\n                <p>The Engine Carbon Clean system works through the air intake of an engine and out through the exhaust system as a gas,\n                helping to remove the excess carbon that leads to poor running issues. \n                It’s a simple and safe process and requires no dismantling of engine parts or the use of harmful chemical products.\n                We recommended using the Engine Carbon Clean service as part of your vehicle’s regular maintenance schedule. \n                </p>\n\n            <h4>What is carbon engine cleaning and is it worth it?</h4>\n            \n                <p>Carbon cleaning can remove sooty carbon deposits from your engine but will it make enough of a difference to justify the price? \n                A well-maintained modern car should be capable of covering six-figure mileages without needing any major attention.\n                But it is reasonable to expect some drop off in performance as a car gets older and components wear.\n                </p>\n\n            <h4>Why might you need your engine carbon cleaned?</h4> \n\n                <p>First, let’s look at the reasons an engine might need to be cleared of carbon at all.\n                Petrols and diesels produce power by burning fuel, and this creates sooty exhaust gases.\n                Emissions control devices such as catalysts and diesel particulate filters keep the amount of soot which reaches the atmosphere to a minimum,\n                but there is still some which is deposited on components inside the engine and exhaust system.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>Vintage cars built before modern oils and fuel technology came about would need a ‘decoke’ every few thousand miles,\n                which involved opening up the engine and physically scraping off the carbon deposits.\n                Thankfully that is no longer the case, but engines can still require a carbon clean - especially (and ironically)\n                those which are fitted with advanced emissions control equipment.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>Petrol cars are usually less susceptible to ‘choking up’, as the fuel is actually quite good at cleaning the components as it passes through.\n                However, many modern engines use Gasoline Direct Injection to improve efficiency where petrol is squirted directly into the combustion chamber and doesn’t get passed over as many parts.\n                This means some GDI engines have a reputation for becoming clogged.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>Diesels are even more affected, as the fuel itself doesn’t burn as cleanly.\n                The exhaust gases are often fed back into the combustion chamber to be burned again and this movement of sooty fumes is bound to result in a build-up of deposits over time.\n                Once the fumes are finally expelled from the engine they still have to pass through a particulate filter and a catalyst.\n                These too can become clogged with carbon deposits.\n                </p>\n\n            <h4>How to avoid the need for carbon cleaning</h4>\n\n                <p>The best way to stop carbon deposits from becoming an issue is to keep the car maintained well.\n                Regular servicing using good quality oil and filters is essential.\n                It’s also important to give your car a good run occasionally.\n                The so-called ‘Italian tune up’ method – driving far enough to get the engine hot and using a few more revs than usual – will help,\n                especially a diesel which needs to regenerate its particulate filter.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>If your car seems to be suffering from a lack of performance, a warning light has illuminated or it has failed its MoT test on emissions,\n                then the first task is to read the owner’s manual and see if it is something you can fix yourself.\n                Once you’ve tried that, try looking online to see if a forum has the answer – it may be a simple problem.\n                </p>\n                    \n        </div>\n
